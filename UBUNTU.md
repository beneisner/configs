# Dev Environment.

## Set up SSH keys for Github

Adding SSH keys means we don't have to enter our username/password every time. macOS does a good job of storing passphrases in the keychain.

1) Add SSH key to account ([Instructions](https://help.github.com/en/articles/connecting-to-github-with-ssh))
    * `ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "ben.a.eisner@gmail.com"`
        * Default location is fine.
        * Save a passphrase in 1Password.
    * Add to Github account.
2) Add SSH key to keychain ([Instructions](https://help.github.com/en/articles/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent#adding-your-ssh-key-to-the-ssh-agent))
    * Create/modify ~/.ssh/config using provided Hosts.
    * `ssh-add -K ~/.ssh/id_rsa`, and enter passphrase. This stores the passphrase in the keychain.


## Bootstrap Configs

1) All code should live in `~/code`, especially if this is a personal computer, so that we don't contaminate personal data.
```
mkdir ~/code && cd ~/code
```

2) Clone this repository into code, so we can access all our configuration files.
```
git clone git@github.com:beneisner/configs.git
```

## tmux


## tmux
