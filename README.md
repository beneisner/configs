# configs
My personal config files, for use when setting up a new computer.

# macOS setup

## macOS Preferences

Preferences that can be found in System Preferences.

* System Preferences > Keyboard > Modifier Keys > Caps Lock Key -> Control
* System Preferences > Keyboard > Key Repeat -> Fast
* System Preferences > Keyboard > Delay until Repeat -> Short
* Enable System Preferences > Trackpad > Point & Click > Tap to Click

## Spectacle

Install and configure Spectacle, a great window manager for macOS.

* Download [Spectacle](https://www.spectacleapp.com/)
* Start Spectacle
    * Allow it Accessibility permissions.
* Enable Spectacle > Preferences > Launch Spectacle at login

## Brew

Brew is the de-facto standard package manager for macOS. We'll install some basics, but we don't really want to use brew for day-to-day development, because it contaminates the machine. 

*Rule of thumb: only `brew install` things that are environment-independent, and are used across coding environments*

```
# Install git, overriding the system default so we can get frequent updates.
brew install git

# Install python3, which is used by various code editors and tools.
# This version should ***NOT*** be used for actually running code we wrote;
# we leave that to the isolated dev environments.
brew install python3
```

## Set up SSH keys for Github

Adding SSH keys means we don't have to enter our username/password every time. macOS does a good job of storing passphrases in the keychain.

1) Add SSH key to account ([Instructions](https://help.github.com/en/articles/connecting-to-github-with-ssh))
    * `ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "ben.a.eisner@gmail.com"`
        * Default location is fine.
        * Save a passphrase in 1Password.
    * Add to Github account.
2) Add SSH key to keychain ([Instructions](https://help.github.com/en/articles/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent#adding-your-ssh-key-to-the-ssh-agent))
    * Create/modify ~/.ssh/config using provided Hosts.
    * `ssh-add -K ~/.ssh/id_rsa`, and enter passphrase. This stores the passphrase in the keychain.

## Bootstrap dev machine

1) All code should live in `~/code`, especially if this is a personal computer, so that we don't contaminate personal data.
```
mkdir ~/code && cd ~/code
```

2) Clone this repository into code, so we can access all our configuration files.
```
git clone git@github.com:beneisner/configs.git
```

## Visual Studio Code

Visual Studio Code has replaced Sublime Text 3 as the de-facto text editor, and has a litany of extensions that are super-useful for everyday coding.

1) [Download Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)

2) Install the following extensions:
    * Python ([ms-python.python](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python)): Python language extension.
  
3) Set up our configuration files by symlinking them into the appropriate directories.

```
ln -s ~/code/configs/vscode/settings.json ~/Library/Application\ Support/Code/User/settings.json
```

## iTerm2

iTerm2 is a great terminal replacement for macOS. I'm not sure why but everyone says it is and that's great.

`brew cask install iterm2`

Allow it Accessibility permissions.

### iTerm2 Color Schemes

Download some slick iTerm2 color schemes.

```

tmux is the best terminal multiplexer out there.
```
