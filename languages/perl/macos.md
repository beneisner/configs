# Perl

Why do we need perl? Probably for LaTeX nonsense.

## [Perlbrew](https://perlbrew.pl/)

```
# Install perlbrew.
curl -L https://install.perlbrew.pl | bash

# Add the following to ZSH.
source ~/perl5/perlbrew/etc/bashrc

# Source shell, install preferred perl, switch to preferred perl, then:
cpan Log::Log4perl
```
